Web server for Floofers, Inc - a fake animal shelter needing a website and database (for CSCI 44300)

## Overall Description:
### 1. Index.ts
This file initializes the Node.js server and uses Express to build route handlers for every page in the website. The routes are generated by a recursive function that uses [fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra), a file-system package, to walk through the files in `/public/views`. For each view it finds, it adds it to routes and, if there is one, also retrieves the controller file and builds that object.

### 2. Controllers
These files are all based on the abstract Controller class, and each handle database queries and page rendering. They run whatever queries are necessary for that page's data, and in order to avoid handling passing back the data object through callbacks to the original route handler, simply renders the page view with that data when it completes its query(ies).

### 3. Public
This directory handles all frontend files - anything served up to the client.
- `/img`: contains images for the page title and any content page that needs them (in this case, employees and pets all have profile images)
- `/js`: contains client side javascript files for any in-page functionality
- `/views`: contains views written in pug
- `/css`: contains the files in the template I used, as well as some custom styles to add some additional features
